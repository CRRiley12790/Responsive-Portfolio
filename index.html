        <div>My Name is Christian Riley. I am 27 years old and a graduate of Kent State University with a Bachelor's in Sports Administration with a Minor in Business. I live in Cleveland, Ohio and I am a huge sports fan. I have a dog named Daisy. She is a 4-year old Vizsla.</div>
            <br>
        <div>I am taking this class because after I never usefully used my degree in the first four years, I recognized my passion for fantasy sports and decided that I wanted to start my own website called Corner Sports. So, I decided to learn how to build it on my own. I figure that if I put in the work, even if Corner Sports does not work as planned, the skills learned would still be a valuable asset moving foward.</div>
